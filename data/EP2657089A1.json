The invention is based on the finding that an airborne situation of a vehicle may be ascertained via a vertical acceleration of the vehicle.For example if same is in a defined tolerance range around 1g e.g.ranging from 0.8 g to 1.2 g one may assume that the vehicle is in the air.In this case this information could be provided to restraint means of the vehicle in order to enable a fast plausibilization of e.g.a trigger decision for a belt pretensioner or to increase the robustness of the airbag triggering in potential off road situations for example. In a further embodiment of the present invention a degree of an accident severity to be expected or a safety relevant airborne situation may be detected in the above method for detecting an airborne situation the method further comprising starting a counter when the acceleration signal exceeds the predetermined acceleration threshold value and comparing a counter reading of the counter to a predetermined counter reading threshold value in order to detect a degree of an accident severity of the vehicle to be expected or of a safety relevant airborne situation of the vehicle when the counter reading is larger than the predetermined counter reading threshold value.",

A particularly advantageous application of the present invention consists in enabling early activation of the timeuncritical restraint means in dangerous driving situations which in complex crash events may occur a considerable time before the actual vehicle collision in which the timecritical restraint means must be activated.An important element in a typical dangerous driving situation the run off road is the ditch drive.",
            "EP1002709": "The sensing module 10 shown herein includes six sensors all preferably assembled together on module 10 and oriented to perform the intended sensing operation.The sensors include a roll angular rate sensor 12 a pitch angular rate sensor 16 a lateral accelerometer 14 a longitudinal accelerometer 18 a vertical accelerometer 20 and a yaw angular rate sensor 25.The roll angular rate sensor 12 measures the time rate of angular roll 13 about the vehicles longitudinal axis while the pitch rate sensor 16 measures the time rate of angular pitch 17 about the vehicles lateral axis.The lateral accelerometer 14 measures acceleration 15 of the vehicle along the vehicles lateral axis.The longitudinal accelerometer 18 measures acceleration 19 of the vehicle along the vehicles longitudinal axis.The vertical accelerometer 20 measures the acceleration 21 of the vehicle along the vehicles vertical axis.The yaw angular rate sensor 25 measures the yaw rate 27 about the vertical axis of the vehicle. Referring to step 150 methodology 130 compares the total acceleration magnitude to a predetermined threshold to determine if the vehicle is airborne.If the acceleration magnitude exceeds the threshold an airborne condition is indicated in step 152.Otherwise step 154 indicates that no airborne condition is present.Proceeding to decision step 156 methodology 130 determines if a rough road condition is present for vehicle roll.This achieved by checking whether the accelerationbased roll angle substantially disagrees with both the previous accelerationbased roll angle and the previous overall roll angle estimate.If this condition is met a roll rough road condition is set in step 160.Otherwise step 158 indicates that no roll rough road condition is detected.Similarly methodology 130 proceeds to decision step 162 to determine if a pitch rough road condition exists.This includes checking to see if the accelerationbased pitch angle substantially disagrees with both the previous accelerationbased pitch angle and previous overall pitch angle estimate.If so a pitch rough road condition is indicated in step 166.Otherwise in step 164 no pitch rough road condition is indicated. MCU 22 processes the various input signals and produces output signals identified as ROLLOVER signal 50 and PITCHOVER signal 52 which are indicative of a predicted vehicle rollover condition and a predicted pitchover condition respectively.In addition MCU 22 provides the predicted rollover and pitchover output signals on line 62 to control designated onboard control devices such as a seat belt reeler control 54 a lap seat belt pretensioner control 56 and a seat belt retractor control 60.Seat belt reeler control 54 controls the seat belt reeler for both the drivers side and passengers side via respective signals DREL and PREL as provided on output line 64 and 66 respectively.Seat belt pretensioner control 56 likewise controls seat belt pretensioning for the drivers side and passengers side via signals DPRET and PPRET as provided on output lines 68 and 70 respectively.A diagnostic current source and sink 58 allows for diagnostic testing of the seat belt reeler control 54 and seat belt pretensioner 56.The seat belt retractor control 60 controls retractor locks associated with the seat belt to both the drivers seat belt and passengers seat belt via signals DRET and PRET as provided on output lines 72 and 74.",
            "EP1619083": "The timer module 15 continuously checks whether the activation conditions are constantly present during predefined time window.In this example the timer module 15 starts operating each time the AND gate 14 changed the state to active binary 1 and checks for how long the gate remains active.If left wheels are lifted up and right wheels are loaded for sufficiently long time the timer module 15 shall transmit the activation signal indicating the right rollover of a vehicle.In this embodiment the activation signal varies within the range 0.0 to 1.0 0100corresponding to the rollover confidence proportionally to the duration of the activation state of the gate 14.The zero activation signal of the timer 15 denotes lack of activation of the gate 14 and the 100activation corresponds to a situation when the gate 14 has been active for 1000 ms Block 39 can realize more than one independent rollover detection processing paths for exampledetection of rollover event on the base of the tire pressure asymmetry as in case of embodiments presented in and detection of rollover event on the base of the high lateral acceleration value e.g.greater than 3g followed by airborne condition sudden pressure drop in all tires detection of rollover event on the base of the vertical andor lateral lowG accelerometer value changes followed by airborne condition sudden pressure drop in all tires Other preprocessed signals like vehicle speed steering angle value andor linear acceleration values are also delivered to the block 39.Owing to this the value of rollover confidence may be additionally modified for more precise determination of driving conditions. To avoid inadvertent and in some cases dangerous activations of protection devices the activation of each protection device occurs only when apart from exceeding of rollover confidence threshold the rollover event occurrence is confirmed by an additional arming logic 40.The arming logic 40 may be implemented in many ways which are known for skilled in the art e.g.disclosed in U.S.Appl.No.09769037.As in almost all modern cars lateral and longitudinal highG accelerometer is present usually as dual axis device for detection of side front and rear impacts to deploy airbags it is reasonable to use the lateral acceleration exceeding predefined threshold as a minimum arming signal what can be done at no cost.The coincidence of these two conditions is signalled at the outputs of three AND gates 41 42 and 43 which are connected directly to the particular protection devices 44 45 and 46. It is also advantageous that block 39 may also detect airborne conditions of the vehicle.As airborne condition all tires have lost the contact with road surface is alsopresent during rollover events additional signals should be used to properly discriminate if airborne or rollover event is present. Activation signal of the timer 15 is the input of the rollover discrimination block 24 which in dependence of the activation signal value deploys an appropriate protection device which in case the activation signal is greater than 20shall be resetable seatbelts greater than 70 shall be rollover bars and in case the activation signal is greater than 90 shall be airbags. In general block 39 can combine tire pressure characteristics with other signals available in the vehicle to make the rollover event prediction more accurate. If the analysis of the block 38 is positive signals are delivered to the rollover assessment block 39 which estimates the rollover confidence as a value within 0 to 100.The block 39 may be implemented in manner similar to these described above with reference to or .In this example the block 39 comprises four outputs wherein each output corresponds to individual threshold of the rollover confidence in excess of which it becomes active.Exemplary value of these thresholds depending on the type of protection device may be 20for resetable seatbelts 70 for rollover bars and 90 for airbags.As shown the rollover discrimination confidence is also delivered to other vehicle systems. Signals of the first path after preprocessing are delivered to the diagnostic block 38 where they are analysed with respect to their accesibility and reliability.If the analysis is negative i.e.one or more signals are out of predefined range the block 38 disables potential activation of protection devices not transferring the signals or transferring zero signals values for further processing.",
            "EP1555165": "The output of the OR gate 8 is connected with the input of the AND gate 9 so that the activation of the YHG path 2 or the ZLG path 3 is the activation of one of the inputs of the AND gate 9. The first main activation YHG path 2 is activated for example during the soil trip sidecollision or a curb trip of a vehicle.The input sensor of the main activation path 2 is a vehicle high lateral acceleration sensor YHG 21 fixed in the vehicle in such a way that its working axis is perpendicular both to the longitudinal and vertical axis of the vehicle.This sensor may be e.g.ADXL50 sensor made by Analog Devices Inc USA.Sensors of this type are capable to detect accelerations in the range from about 0 g to about 50 g.A sensor signal 21 is preprocessed in a preprocessing module 23.Then modulus of the output signal of the module 23 is compared in comparator 24 with a predefined threshold value 22 thresholdYHG.If a vehicle lateral acceleration exceeds a predefined threshold value TRUE logic signal occurs at the output of comparator 24.By setting the value thresholdYHG in the range within 2 g to 3 g it is possible to detect certain dangerous situations without activation of the unit during normal driving conditions.Greater accelerations are usually accompanied with a vehicle rollover near rollover event or other dangerous situations.The output value of the comparator 24 is subsequently sustained for a predefined period in the module 25 latch ingYHG and constitutes the first input of the OR gate 8. In many rollover detection systems two paths of signal processing are used a main path and an independent arming path constituting separate safety logic.An essential purpose of safety logic is to decrease the probability of inadvertent deployment in an event of failure or error of main rollover detection logic.An example of such a system is disclosed in U.S.Pat.6535800. As in the embodiment shown in the activation signals of the additional activation paths 4 5 and 6 constitute the inputs of the OR gate 7 but the output of the gate 7 is coupled with the input of the AND gate 9 the second input of which is the output of the comparator 34 of the second main activation path 3.The thresholdZLG 32 was set up to about 0.85 g that results in high sensitivity of the ZLG path to vertical vibrations occurring e.g.during driving the vehicle on a rough road but the second main activation path 3 shall be activated only when besides activation of the comparator 34 at least one additional activation path 4 5 or 6 is active. In order not to cause activation of the logic unit during a normal driving conditions the unit 1 comprises three additional activation paths the first 4 the second 5 and the third 6 activation path.The output signals of these paths constitute inputs of the OR gate 7.The output of the gate 7 is the second input of the AND gate 9.The TRUE signal at the output of the gate 9 is an activation signal of the logic unit 1. Rollover detection logic units are commonly connected with proper sensors and are employed in rollover detections systems which aim is to deploy appropriate protection devices such as seat belts pretensioners popup roll bars or air bags in particular air bags protecting occupants heads in case of a rollover accident. In practical applications it is favourable to employ two separate ECUs a main unit and an additional safety unit such as logic unit of the present invention.The main unit and the safety unit may also be implemented in two separate microcontrollers of the same ECU. The second main activation ZLG path 3 is activated for example when a vehicle is falling into a ditch or moving with a big bank.The input element of the path 3 is a vehicle low vertical acceleration sensor ZLG 31 the working axis of which is parallel to the vehicle vertical axis.The sensor is capable to detect low acceleration in the range from about 0 g to about 2 g.The signal of the sensor 31 is processed in the preprocessing module 33 then modulus of the output signal of the module 33 is compared in the comparator 34 with a predefined threshold value 32thresholdZLG.If a vehicle vertical acceleration exceeds the threshold the TRUE signal occurs at the output of comparator 34.One may assume that a 45 degree bank of a vehicle in relation to a horizontal surface is a dangerous situation which may lead to a vehicle rollover.To detect this situation the thresholdZLG should be set to about 0.7 g which corresponds to a gravitation component acting on the sensor ZLG g cos45.The filtered signal value is compared with the threshotdZLG value so that the TRUE signal occurs at the output of the comparator 34 only when the bank of vehicle exceeds 45.An output value of the comparator 34 is sustained for a predefined period latchingZHG in the module 35 and constitutes the second input of the OR gate 8."
