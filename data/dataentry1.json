    "EP2479812": "The frame 16 can be formed from the same material as the base board 10 such as with aluminum nitride having a high thermal conductivity ceramics and the like.The frame 16 can be attached on the outer perimeter of the mounting surface of the base board 10 via an adhesive material so as to surround the semiconductor lightemitting chips 11 and the wavelength converting layer 13 which is located between the semiconductor lightemitting chips 11 and the optical plate 14. Semiconductor lightemitting devices in which a part of light emitted from a semiconductor lightemitting chip is converted into light having a different wavelength by a phosphor and in which a mixture light including the light having the different wavelength mixed with the light emitted directly from the lightemitting chip is emitted have been used as a light source for various lighting units.Conventional semiconductor lightemitting devices including a wavelength converting material for example are disclosed in Patent Document No.1 Japanese Patent Application Laid Open JP200431989 The presently disclosed subject matter has been devised in view of the above and other problems features and characteristics.Aspects of the disclosed subject matter include a vehicle headlight using semiconductor lightemitting devices having a high lightemitting efficiency and a substantially uniform white tone and also include methods of manufacture that provide the semiconductor lightemitting devices having various small lightemitting surfaces and a high lightemitting efficiency such that can be used as a light source for a vehicle headlight and which can provide a similar lead time while using a similar manufacture machine in comparison with conventional semiconductor lightemitting devices and processes. The reflective material layer 15 can be made by dispersing a reflective filler such as titanium oxide zinc oxide and the like into a transparent resin such as a silicone resin and can be disposed between the frame 16 and the side surfaces of the wavelength converting layer 13 and the optical plate 14 so as to fill a space between both the bottom surface of each of the lightemitting chips 11 and the at least one convex surface of the wavelength converting layer 13 and the mounting surface of the base board 10. Each of the lightemitting chips 11 can also include an LED of InGaN series that emits nearultraviolet light having a wavelength of approximately 380 nanometers a laserdiode that emits ultraviolet light and the like.In this case in order to emit substantially white light the at least one phosphor can include a red phosphor e.g.CaAlSiN3 Eu2 wavelengthconverting the ultraviolet light into red light a green phosphor e.g.Si Al6 O N Eu2 wavelengthconverting the ultraviolet light into green light and a blue phosphor e.g.Sr Ca Ba Mg10PO46C12 Eu2 wavelengthconverting the ultraviolet light into blue light. The presently disclosed subject matter relates to semiconductor lightemitting devices in which light emitted from at least one semiconductor lightemitting chip is wavelengthconverted by a wavelength converting layer and to manufacturing methods for the same.More particularly the disclosed subject matter relates to semiconductor lightemitting devices for a vehicle light and the like which can emit light having a high lightemitting efficiency and a uniform color tone from various small lightemitting surfaces and to methods of manufacturing such devices."
