  "EP2471670A1": "A pneumatic tire with a tire flattening rate of more than 55 and less than 70 wherein on a meridian cross section of a tire which is mounted on a standard wheel rim and in a condition with an internal pressure of 5 which is 5 of a standard internal pressure applied a contour line of a surface of a tread portion forms an arc having a single radius of curvature the pneumatic tire has in the tread portion circumferential main grooves including shoulder circumferential main grooves which continuously extend in a tire circumferential direction and are arranged at the axial outermost side of the tire and a plurality of shoulder lateral grooves which are provided on shoulder land portions arranged on the tire axial outer side of the shoulder circumferential main groove and which not only extend from the tire axial outer side of a tread groundcontact edge to a ti re axial inner side but also have an inner end in a ti re axial direction terminating within the shoulder land portions furthermore the shoulder lateral grooves have anglewith respect to the tire circumferential direction in a range of 80 to 90 and a tire axial distance Ds between the tire axially inner end and the shoulder circumferential main groove is in a range of 3.5 to 5.5 mm and the shoulder lateral grooves have the deepest part where thegroove depth is largest and the groove depth of the deepest part is made 70 to 90 of the groove depth of the shoulder circumferential main groove.",

    "EP2204294":"In Figs.7A to 7C are shown cross section views of outer crown circumferential groove 3o and inner and outer shoulder circumferential grooves 4i and 4o.Each of the circumferential grooves 3o 4i and 4o has a corner portion C1 on the tire equator side and a corner portion C2 on the ground contact edge side at which both groove walls 42 intersect with the tread surface 2S.In this embodiment each of the corner portions C1 and C2 are cut off by a slant face to provide a chamfered portion 43.The chamfered portion 43 is inclined at an angle 3 of 50 to 70 with respect to the normal line to the tread surface 2S.Since a poor rigidity portion at the corner portions C1 and C2 are removed rubber chipping and uneven wear which may occur at the corner portions C1 and C2 when a lateral force or the like acts thereon are effectively prevented. An inner shoulder land portion 7i located between the inner shoulder circumferential groove 4i and the inner ground contact edge Ei of the tread is divided into inner and outer land portions 7i1 and 7i2 as shown in Fig.6 by a sipelike narrow circumferential groove 35 extending in the circumferential direction and having a groove width of 1.0 mm or less.The inner land portion 7i1 is provided with a plurality of shoulder lateral grooves 10i extending from the inner tread ground contact edge Ei whereby the inner land portion 7i1 is divided into a plurality of shoulder blocks 17i.The shoulder lateral grooves 10i are substantially identical to grooves that the shoulder lateral grooves 10o have been symmetrically moved with respect to an arbitrary point on the tire equator C.The outer land portion 7i2 is formed as a circumferentially continuous rib portion 36 without being crossed by any lateral groove and any sipe.Like this since the outer land portion 7i2 adjacent to the inner shoulder circumferential groove 4i is formed as a circumferentially continuous rib portion 36 columnar resonance is hard to occur in the inner shoulder circumferential groove 4i and accordingly deterioration of the noise performance can be suppressed.Further rigidity balance on both sides of the inner shoulder circumferential groove 4i can be optimized. Fig.8 shows a cross section view taken on line BB in Fig.5.In this embodiment each of the shoulder lateral grooves 10o is provided with a tiebar 20 that the groove bottom rises on the outer shoulder circumferential groove 4o side.The tiebar 20 connects root portions of circumferentially adjacent shoulder blocks 17o 17o whereby the rigidity is increased to improve the steering stability and the braking performance.The tiebar 20 also serves to prevent the shoulder block 17o from falling down in the circumferential direction thereby effectively suppressing uneven wear such as a socalled heeltoe wear of the shoulder block 17o in cooperation with the chamfered portions 44.Further since the tiebar 20 will come into contact with a road surface as the tread portion 2 is worn away enhancement of grip performance after middle stage of wear can be expected thereby.",
    "EP2311659":"Plural shoulder lug grooves 30 are formed at the tire width direction outside of the second fine grooves 28 extending toward the tire width direction outside from the second fine grooves 28 and plural shoulder blocks 32 are partitioned by the second fine grooves 28 and the shoulder lug grooves 30. In a similar manner to the first fine grooves 18 the second fine grooves 28 have a narrower groove width than that of the first circumferential direction groove 14 and the second circumferential direction grooves 20.The groove width of the second fine grooves 28 is set such that a wall face 26A of the shoulder rib 26 which is a groove wall of the second fine groove 28 makes contact with the wall face 32A of the shoulder block 32 when the tread12 makes ground contact and the shoulder ribs 26 and the shoulder blocks 32 respective undergo compressive deformation.In the second fine grooves 28 of the present exemplary embodiment the groove width is substantially constant from the groove bottom up to the groove opening portion at the tread surface side.The groove width of the second fine grooves 28 is for example preferably set at 1.0 mm or below.In the present exemplary embodiment the groove depth of the second fine grooves 28 is set at 50 of the groove depth of the first circumferential direction groove 14 and the second circumferential direction groove 20. The shoulder lug grooves 30 are smoothly curved and if W is defined as the length along the tire width direction from the ground contact edge 12E to the wall face 32A at the second fine groove 28 side of the shoulder block 32 then with reference to a straight line HL shown in FIG.1 as a double dashed intermittent line extending in the tire circumferential direction through a point at 13 W from the wall face 32A along the tire width direction toward the tire width direction the shoulder lug grooves 30 are configured with a lug groove outside portion 30A that is the portion to the tire width direction outside of the straight line HL and a lug groove inside portion 30B that is the portion to the tire width direction inside of the straight line HL.The lug groove outside portion 30A and the lug groove inside portion 30B have a different average angle with respect to the tire width direction with the average angle of the lug groove outside portions 30A set smaller than the average angle of the lug groove inside portions 30B.It should be noted that the angle of a groove with respect to the tire width direction indicates here the angle of a center line passing through the center of the groove with respect to the tire width direction.In FIG.1 the average angle of the lug groove outside portions 30A with respect to the tire width direction is shown by the angled single dashed intermittent line annotated L1 and the average angle of the lug groove inside portions 30B with respect to the tire width direction is shown by the angled single dashed intermittent line annotated L2.The angular differencebetween the intermittent line L1 and the intermittent line L2 is preferably set in the range of 10 to 70 degrees."
