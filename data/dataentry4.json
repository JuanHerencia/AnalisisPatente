    "EP2128299":"US 2006280955 The present invention furthermore relates to a method for making a component as described above.Preferably this method is characterised in that a component provided with at least one layer comprising chemically stabilised zirconia preferablyYSZ is coated with a protective layer using a coating process selected from slurry coating thermal spray coating physical vapor deposition chemical vapor deposition depositing CaO and reacting it in a furnace with a controlled atmosphere containing between 10 Pa and 1000 Pa of SO2 and 100 Pa to 25 kPa of O2 at temperature ranging from 300C to 800C.CaSO4 or CaSO42H2O can also be directly deposited in the form of a layer on the coating as a protective layer. Thermal barrier coatings can be destabilized by environmental contaminants mostly by calciaaluminamagnesia silicates CMAS forming a deposit that can react with yttria stabilized zirconia and lead to TBC spallation. The present invention furthermore relates to the use of a number of systems for the prevention of calcium diffusion into the thermal barrier coating layer comprising chemically stabilised zirconia.The proposed systems are selected from the group of calcia stabilized zirconia CaSO4 SrZrO3 CaZrO3 Cadoped SrZrO3 Srdoped CaZrO3 in the outer an outer zone of a thermal barrier coating comprising chemically stabilisedzirconia of a component andor as a protective layer of the thermal barrier coating comprising chemically stabilised zirconia.Preferably calcium sulphate is used as a protective layer essentially consisting of calcium sulphate only on a thermal barrier coating layer essentially consisting of yttriastabilised zirconia. We observed experimentally that when CaSO4 was present it was not reacting with YSZ. As can be seen from the abovereferred patent documents of the state of the art CaSO4 is not considered as a common product that can be formed in a gas turbine under CMAS attack.The only patent mentioning CaSO4 namely US 20060280955 Therefore the mitigation mechanism cannot efficiently rely on proposed solutions according to the stateoftheart of impermeable or sacrificial coatings protecting from molten deposit contamination.What is needed is a layer or a system which is not reacting with the environmental contaminant compositions and which is also not reacting with the material of the layer comprising chemically stabilised zirconia.It is therefore not necessary that such a protective materiallayer is impermeable or sacrificalas always described to be necessary and crucial in the systems according to the stateoftheart.Quite by contrast what is important is that the material of the protective layerinfiltration zone is neither reacting with environmental contaminant compositions that contain oxides of calcium specifically CMAS nor reacting with the TBC material.Preferably in addition to that it shows a low diffusion coefficient for calcium coming from the combustion environment preferably it shows an essentially vanishing diffusion coefficient for calcium coming from the combustion environment. The CMAS attack mechanism has been identified to proceed through Ca diffusion in the YSZ leading to its destabilization even through solidstate reaction.The TBC degradation mechanism does not need to involve a molten deposit as always assumed up to now it can happen through gaseous contaminants reacting directly with YSZ leading to Cainfiltration in the YSZ.The diffusion of Ca in the YSZ layer changes the microstructure of the asdeposited partially stabilized zirconia with 68 wt yttria leading to an increased content of fully stabilized zirconia.This increased content of fully stabilized zirconia leads to an increase of residual stresses in the TBC and the destabilization of the TBC layer and its spallation. CaSO4 is thus not a normal product found in a gas turbine under CMAS attack.When CMAS attack occurs the S amount is not enough to react with all the CaO present.So even if a gas turbine is operated with sands quartz SiO2 is the predominant sand constituent as well as limestone mostly CaCO3 feldspar chlorite glauconite all three are silicates and all these materials are not containing sulfur or only as a minor contaminant.Sands composed of these materials do not produce CaSO4 to an extent which would lead to layer with a protection effect. Typically such a protective layer has a thickness in the range of 102000 micro metre preferably in the range of 10100 micro metre.Preferably the protective layer andor the infiltration zone cover the component over the full surface which is exposed to the hot air streamscombustion air stream.It is however also possible that the protective layer andor the infiltration zone only covers the most exposed areas. For the person skilled in the art CaSO4 is thus not considered as a product found in a gas turbine under CMAS attack let alone forming a protective layer.In fact CaSO4 can be formed from CaO only under very specific conditions. The object of the present invention is therefore to provide an improved thermal barrier coating for components which are exposed to hot air flows as for example in gas turbines.Specifically the thermal barrier coating shall be improved in respect of resistance to environmental contaminant compositions that contain oxides of calcium so thermal barrier coatings which are less prone to CMAS attack.Furthermore the object is to provide methods for making such thermal barrier coatings and to uses of specific systems as protective layers for barrier coatings. Most of these documents are disclosing materials that should react with the liquid deposit forming a solid phase that should not infiltrate the TBC.The other documents describe impermeable coatings that should prevent the liquid infiltration. Preferably the component provided with at least one layer comprising chemically stabilised zirconia is made in that the component typically made of superalloy is preferably grit blasted bond coat deposited for example by atmospheric plasma spray or high velocity oxygen fuel thermal spray and subsequently chemically stabilised zirconia preferably yttriastabilised zirconia thermal barrier coat deposited by plasma spraying. The solution proposed in this invention thus relies on CMAS attack mitigation by using an outer layer that is not reacting with Ca.This could be performed using outer layer having a high Ca content but also other materials known to be inert with respect to CaO. Ca has been demonstrated to diffuse through a solidstate process from the combustion environment to the yttriastabilized zirconia YSZ TBC layer.In yttriastabilized zirconia coatings that have been coated with the systems proposed in this invention for example calcium sulphate CaSO4 no Ca diffusion into the TBC layer has been observed diffusion coefficient essentially zero and correspondingly the underlying TBC layers are highly protected from the abovementioned CMAS attack.Also Ca containing protective compositions have a reduced diffusion coefficient for Ca coming from the combustion environment and can fulfil the same function. It is to be noted that only if specific processing conditions are present the formation of such a useful protective layer from CaO takes place.In fact CaSO4 can be formed onlyunder such specific conditions i.e.when an exceptionally high sulfur content is present in the atmosphere as given in the above processing conditions.Such a high sulphur content is never achieved under normal operating conditions in a gas turbine. The present invention therefore relates to a barrier coating structure or more specifically to a component with a thermal barrier coating on the surface thereof wherein thethermal barrier coating comprises at least one layer comprising chemically stabilised zirconia.According to the invention such a barrier coating structure is in particular characterised in that at least indirectly adjacent to the layer comprising chemically stabilised zirconia and on its surface facing side so on the side which directly or indirectly faces the hot air streams and is therefore exposed to the abovementioned contaminants there is provided a protective layer.This can actually be a true protective layer which is separate it may however also be an infiltration zone in which a protective material penetrates into the layer comprising chemically stabilised zirconia.The protective layer the infiltration zone or generally speaking the protective material is characterised in that it is not reacting with environmental contaminant compositions that contain oxides of calcium and which is not reacting with the material of the layer comprising chemically stabilised zirconia.",
    "EP1788122":"As with prior art TBCs the TBC 26 of this invention is intended to be deposited to a thickness that is sufficient to provide the required thermal protection for the underlying substrate 22 and blade 10.A suitable thickness is generally on the order of about 75 to about 300 micrometers.A preferred material for the TBC 26 is yttriastabilized zirconia YSZ a preferred composition being about 3 to about 8 weight percent yttria 38YSZ though other ceramic materials could be used such as nonstabilized zirconia or zirconia partially or fully stabilized by magnesia ceria scandia or other oxides. The present invention generally provides a process for protecting a thermal barrier coating TBC on a component used in a hightemperature environment such as the hot section of a gas turbine engine.The invention is particularly directed to a process by which a CMAS inhibitor is applied so as to form a protective deposit on the surface of the TBC as well as infiltrate porosity within the TBC thereby providing the benefits of an additive portion overlying the TBC and available for sacrificial consumption as well as an internal portion within the TBC to maintain a level of CMAS protection in the event the additive portion is breached or lost through spallation erosion andor consumption. The surface of the airfoil 12 is protected by a TBC system 20 represented in Figure 2 as including a metallic bond coat 24 that overlies the surface of a substrate 22 the latter of which is typically the base material of the blade 10 and preferably formed of a superalloy such as a nickel cobalt or ironbase superalloy.As widely practiced with TBC systems for components of gas turbine engines the bond coat 24 is preferably an aluminumrich composition such as an overlay coating of an MCrAlX alloy or a diffusion coating such as a diffusion aluminide or a diffusion platinum aluminide all of which are wellknown in the art.Aluminumrich bond coats develop an aluminum oxide alumina scale 28 which grows as a result of oxidation of the bond coat 24.The alumina scale 28 chemically bonds a TBC 26 formed of a thermalinsulating material to the bond coat 24 and substrate 22.The TBC 26 of Figure 2 is represented as having a straintolerant microstructure of columnar grains.As known in the art such columnar microstructures can be achieved by depositing the TBC 26 using a physical vapor deposition PVD technique such as EBPVD.The invention is also applicable to noncolumnar TBC deposited by such methods as plasma spraying including air plasma spraying APS.A TBC of this type is in the form of molten splats resulting in a microstructure characterized by irregular flattened and therefore noncolumnar grains and a degree of inhomogeneity and porosity. The process of this invention generally entails applying to a surface of the TBC a liquid containing at least one alumina precursor chosen from the group consisting of long chain aluminum alkoxides aluminum betadiketonates aluminum carboxylates and aluminum alkyls.The liquid is applied so as to form a liquid film on the TBC surface and has viscosity and wetting properties that cause the liquid to infiltrate porosity within the TBC beneath its surface.The TBC is then heated to convert the alumina precursor to alumina.A first portion of the alumina forms a surface depositon the TBC surface while a second portion of the alumina forms an internal deposit within the porosity of the TBC. In view of the above while various approaches are known for depositing alumina and other CMAS inhibitors there is an ongoing need for deposition methods capable of depositing an effective amount of a CMAS inhibitor on andor within a TBC that will optimize the ability of the inhibitor to prevent damage from CMAS infiltration. Application of the coating liquid to the TBC 26 can be by dipping or spraying though other application techniques are also possible.Once deposited the coating liquid forms a liquid film that both overlies the TBC surface 32 as well as penetrates the TBC 26 through the open porosity within the TBC 26 such as the gaps 34 between columns.The film is optionally dried to evaporate excess moisture from the liquid for the purpose permitting handling after which the component 10 is heated to convert the precursor to alumina.In the case of the preferred aluminum isopropoxide and aluminum sbutoxide precursors suitable conversion temperatures are in a range of about 300 to about 1100C.The application and heating steps may be repeated multiple times to achieve the targeted weight gain per unit area of the TBC surface 32.As an aid to increase the infiltration efficiency a vacuum or pressure infiltration technique may be used andor the coating liquid andor component 10 can be heated to reduce the viscosity of the applied liquid. Various studies have been performed to find coating materials that are resistant to infiltration by CMAS.Notable examples are commonlyassigned U.S.Patent Nos.5660885 Another approach capable of infiltrating a TBC with a CMAS inhibitor is liquid infiltration with a precursor of the inhibitor.To be successful the precursor and any solvents carriers etc.used therewith must not damage the TBC other layers of the TBC system or the substrate protected by the TBC system.Other key requirements for a successful liquid infiltration approach include achieving an adequate degree of infiltration and depositing an effective quantity of alumina.To promote the latter the precursor should contain a relatively high level of aluminum that can be converted to yield a known or predictable amount of alumina.Some known alumina precursors and their conversion efficiencies include aluminum chloride 0.237 aluminum bromide 0.128 aluminum acetate 0.161 aluminum nitrate 0.052 and aluminum sulfate 0.033.However these sulfate and halide compounds are known to attack bond coat and superalloy materials typically present in TBC applications and aqueous solutions of these compounds exhibit poor wettability to TBC materials.For those precursors requiring a solvent or carrier another important consideration is the solubility of the precursor in its carrier since a precursor with a high conversion efficiency will not be effective if only a small loading of the precursor can be placed into solution. According to a preferred aspect of the invention the protective deposit 30 contains alumina more preferably is predominantly alumina and may consist entirely of alumina though other compounds could be used such as the sacrificial coating materials disclosed in the abovenoted patents to Hasz et al.whose contents relating to such sacrificial coating materials are incorporated herein by reference.The alumina content of the protective deposit 30 is sacrificially consumed by reacting with molten CMAS that deposits on the deposit 30 and possibly infiltrates the gaps 34 of the TBC 26 and in doing so forms one or more refractory phases with higher melting temperatures than CMAS.In effect the alumina content of the molten CMAS is increased yielding a modified CMAS with a higher melting andor greater viscosity.As a result the reaction product of CMAS and the alumina content of the protective deposit 30 more slowly infiltrates the TBC 26 and tends to resolidify before sufficient infiltration has occurred to cause spallation. Of particular interest to the present invention is the susceptibility of TBC materials including YSZ to attack by CMAS.As discussed previously CMAS is a relatively low melting compound that when molten is able to infiltrate columnar and noncolumnar TBCs and subsequently resolidify to promote spallation during thermal cycling.To address this concern the TBC 26 in Figure 2 is shown as being provided with a protective deposit 30 of this invention.As a result of being on the outermost surface of the blade 10 the protective deposit 30 serves as a barrier to CMAS infiltration of the underlying TBC 26.The protective deposit 30 is shown in Figure 2 as comprising an additive portion that overlies the surface 32 of the TBC 26 so as to be available for sacrificial reaction with CMAS and further comprises an internal infiltrated portion that extends into porosity within the TBC 26 so as to maintain a level of CMAS protection in the event the additive portion is breached or lost through spallation erosion andor consumption.In the case of the columnar TBC 26 schematically represented in Figure 2 such porosity is represented in part as being defined by gaps 34 between individual columns of the TBC 26.However porosity is also likely to be present within the columns for example in the surfaces of individual columns if the TBC 26 were deposited by EBPVD to have a featherlike grain structure as known in the art. The coating liquid may optionally contain a suspension of fine alumina particles.To promote infiltration of the liquid into the porosity e.g.gaps 34 of the TBC 26 the alumina particles are preferably limited to a mean diameter of less than one micrometer and do not constitute more than 20 volume percent of the liquid with a suitable volume content believed to be in a range of about 5 to about 10 percent. Chemical vapor deposition CVD processes have been shown to be capable of being optimized for either higher deposition rates that primarily deposit alumina as a discrete additive layer on the outer TBC surface or lower deposition rates that promote infiltration of a relatively small amount of alumina into the open porosity of a TBC.Spallation tests with CMAS contamination have indicated that TBCs protected with either approach exhibit similar CMAS resistance even though those primarily infiltrated with alumina have much lower alumina contents.However the CVD deposition of alumina with good penetration into the porosity of a TBC generally requires expensive specialized equipment and is typically limited to very low deposition rates. As indicated above the degree of infiltration is associated with the ability of the system to wet and flow into the very small pores found in TBCs produced by such methods as PVD and plasma spraying.The precursorcontaining liquid being infiltrated must be able to wet the TBC surface and quickly flow into its small pores.These characteristics are associated with the surface tension and viscosity of the liquid.Excessively high surface tensions and viscosities will result in a CMAS inhibitor located primarily on the TBC surface where it is susceptible to erosion and spallation loss. According to the invention the protective deposit 30 is formed by applying to the TBC surface 32 a coating liquid containing an alumina precursor more particularly one or more metalloorganic organometallic compounds that contain aluminum and preferably one or more long chain aluminum alkoxides AlOR3 aluminum carboxylates AlRCOO3 aluminum betadiketonates AlR2C3O23 and aluminum alkyls AlR3 where R is an alkyl or aryl organic fragment.Most preferred of these are aluminum isopropoxide AlOC3H73 and aluminum sbutoxide AlOC4 H93.These precursors are believed to have adequate alumina conversion capability and are noncorrosive to the TBC system 20 e.g.yttriastabilized zirconia of the TBC 26 aluminum and aluminides of the bond coat 24 and alumina of the scale 28 or the underlying superalloy substrate 22.Long chain aluminum alkoxides betadiketonates alkyls and carboxylates such as aluminum isopropoxide aluminum sbutoxide aluminum methoxide aluminum ethoxide and aluminum acetylacetonate and particularly aluminum isopropoxide and aluminum sbutoxide further have the advantage of low melting points about 128 to 132 C for aluminum isopropoxide and below room temperature for aluminum sbutoxide allowing a coating liquid consisting entirely of the precursor to be used.However the preferred precursors are also highly soluble in organic solvents.By dissolving the precursors in a suitablesolvent improved wettabilty and reduced viscosity result thereby promoting the infiltration of the intracolumnar gaps 34 of the TBC 26.Particularly suitable solvents are believed to be those with a polarity equal to or less than that of acetone with preferred solvents believed to be acetone xylene hexane toluene methyl ethyl ketone MEK and furan. As represented in Figure 2 the additive portion of the protective deposit 30 may form a discontinuous layer on the outer surface 32 of the TBC 26.As such a suitable amount of the protective deposit 30 for protecting the TBC 26 is believed to be best quantified by weight per unit TBC surface area.For example a suitable amount of protective deposit 30 is about 1 to 10 mgcm2 of surface area for an EBPVD TBC having a thickness of about three to ten mils about 75 to about 250 micrometers with a more preferred amount for such a coating being about 1.5 to 6 mgcm2.The degree to which the internal portion of the protective deposit 30 occupies the gaps 34 between TBC grains will depend in part on the particular composition used to form the protective deposit 30 as discussed in greater detail below and particularly on the structure of the TBC 26 with more open porosity receiving and needing greater amounts of the internal deposit. In view of the above the process of this invention produces a protective deposit capable of increasing the temperature capability of a TBC by reducing the vulnerability of the TBC to spallation and the underlying substrate to corrosion from CMAS contamination.As a result of the type of precursor used and the process by which the precursor is applied the protective deposit can be formed so as to not only cover the surface of the TBC but also extend protection into subsurface regions of the TBC where resistance to CMAS is also important for longterm resistance to CMAS contamination. The present invention will be described in reference to a high pressure turbine blade 10 shown in Figure 1 though the invention is applicable to a variety of components that operate within a thermally and chemically hostile environment.The blade 10 generally includes an airfoil 12 against which hot combustion gases are directed during operation of the gas turbine engine and whose surfaces are therefore subjected to severe attack by oxidation hot corrosion and erosion as well as contamination by CMAS.The airfoil 12 is anchored to a turbine disk not shown with a dovetail 14formed on a root section 16 of the blade 10.Cooling holes 18 are present in the airfoil 12 through which bleed air is forced to transfer heat from the blade 10.",
    "EP1609885":"The outer coating 28 is generally an aluminabase silicabound ceramic material.More particularly the outer coating 28 contains alumina Al2O3 dispersed within a binder matrix material composed of silica SiO2 silicates andor mullite 3Al2O32SiO2 the relative amounts of which will vary depending on the firing temperature and subsequent service temperatures seen by the coating 28 with greater amounts of mullite forming at higher temperatures.The coating 28 is depicted as comprising an inner layer 30 contacting the TBC 26 and an outer layer 32 defining the outermost surface 34 with the combined thicknesses of the layers 30 and 32 being less than that of the TBC 26.The compositions of the layers 30 and 32 are tailored for their particular function.The inner layer 30 is preferably limited to containing alumina in a silica matrix material while the outer layer 32 includes alumina as well as a glass and zinc titanate Zn2TiO4 in a silica matrix material.While alumina is the preferred constituent of the coating 28 up to about 65 percent by weight of the alumina could be replaced by other metal oxides such as zirconia ZrO2 magnesia MgO titania TiO2 or mullite. While many TBC systems use YSZ deposited by APS as the outermost layer drawbacks include the roughness of the TBC surface erosion resistance and transmissivity to infrared IR radiation.Within the operating environment of a gas turbine surface roughness increases turbulent heat transfer from the hot combustion gases to the component and reduces aerodynamic performance.While surface roughness can be reduced by polishing such as tumbling or hand polishing the final surface finish and thickness of the TBC cannot be closely controlled and the additional processing costs are undesirable.Though crystalline YSZ is very resistant to erosion the erosion resistance of a YSZ APSTBC is significantly reduced as a result of its porosity and microcrack structure the result of which is that fine particle bombardment dislodges small pieces of the TBC.In regard to IR transmissivity analysis has shown that YSZ is about 20 to 70 transparent to thermal radiation wavelengths of about 780 nm to about 1 mm when deposited by APS to thicknesses of about 250 to 500 micrometers.As a result the thermalprotection provided by YSZ APSTBC is compromised in environments that have high thermal radiation loads such as within the combustor 10 of Figure 1.Finally another consideration is the susceptibility of YSZ TBCs to attack by CMAS which is a relatively low melting eutectic that when molten is able to infiltrate conventional TBC and promote spallation during thermal cycling. The present invention will be described in reference to a combustor 12 of an industrial gas turbine 10 a portion of which is shown in crosssection in Figure 1.The combustor 12 is one of multiple canannular combustors located about the periphery of the turbine 10 and has a cantype liner 14 whose interior defines a combustion chamber of the turbine 10.The liner 14 is inserted into a transition piece 18 with multiple fuel nozzle assemblies 16 located at the head end of the liner 14.Both fuel and water may be injected into the combustion chamber through the nozzle assemblies 16 with the injection ofwater being for the purpose of reducing combustion temperatures and consequently NOx emissions.The invention is not limited to combustors having the configuration shown in Figure 1 but instead is applicable to other combustor configurations such as the wellknown annular type. A glass frit zinc titanate a silica precursor and a liquid carrier preferably make up the balance of the slurry.Glass frit particles constitute about 0 to about 35 weight percent of the slurry more preferably about 10 to about 25 weight percent of the slurry for the outer layer 32.A preferred glass frit material is a proprietary composition commercially available from Vitripak Inc.under the name V212 with a particle size of 325 mesh less than 45 micrometers in diameter.While other glass frit materials could foreseeably be used such as V55B and V213 glass frit available from Vitripak and 7052 glass frit available from Corning the V212 material has been shown to be suitable for having a melting temperature and coefficient of thermal expansion that are compatible with the superalloy substrate 22 and the operating environment within a gas turbine.Zinc titanate particles constitute about 0 to about 35 weight percent of the slurry more preferably about 10 to about 25 weight percent of the slurry for the outer layer 32 with a suitable particle size being 325 mesh less than 45 micrometers in diameter. The TBC 26 is depicted as having been deposited by air plasma spraying APS by which splats of molten material are deposited on the bond coat 24.As indicated the TBC 26 has a degree of inhomogeneity and porosity that typically occurs in coatings produced by plasma spraying.In addition the surface of the TBC 26 is relatively rough with a surface roughness of about 200 to 500 microinches Ra about 5 to 13 micrometers Ra being typical for YSZ deposited by APS APSTBC.While depositing the TBC 26 by APS is of particular interest to this invention other plasma spraying techniques could also be used such as low pressure plasma spraying LPPS also known as vacuum plasma spraying VPS.The TBC 26 is deposited to a thickness thatis sufficient to provide the required thermal protection for the underlying substrate 22 and liner 14. The bond coat 24 is preferably an NiCrAlY overlay coating and the TBC 26 is zirconia stabilized by about eight weight percent yttria 8YSZ.The bond coat 24 is preferably deposited by APS to a thickness of about 0.007 to about 0.010 inch about 175 to about 250 micrometers and has an average surface roughness Ra of at least about 320 microinches about 8 microinches to promote adhesion of the TBC 26.Though not required by the invention the TBC 26 is depicted as having a construction disclosed in commonlyassigned U.S.Patent No.6047539 to Farmer whereby the TBC 26 has vertical microcracks 36 that extend through at least onehalf the thickness of the TBC 26 and the density of the TBC 26 is preferably at least 90 of theoretical i.e.contains less than 10 porosity by volume and more preferably less than 8 porosity by volume.A suitable thickness for the TBC is about 760 to about 2500 micrometers. The above solid components are combined with an appropriate amount of silica precursor and a sufficient amount of carrier liquid to yield a slurry.Similar to the inner layer 30 a suitable precursor for the silicacontaining matrix material of the outer layer 32 is a silicone such as polymethyl siloxane a particular example of which is a resin manufactured by GE Silicones under the name SR355.This silicone is also classified as a methylsesquisiloxane mixture of the polysiloxane family but yields less silica when fired than the SR350 silicone used to form the inner layer 30.A higher silica content is preferred for the inner layer 30 to promote the yield strength of the inner layer30 thereby increasing the compliance of the inner layer 30 to promote strain isolation resulting from CTE mismatch between the TBC 26 and the outer layer 32.Finally the same liquid carrier used to form the slurry for the inner layer 30 can be used to form the slurry for the outer layer 32.A suitable slurry contains about 1 to about 45 weight percent of the silica precursor and about 5 to about 95 weight percent of the carrier liquid. A thermal barrier coating TBC system 20 of a type suitable for thermally insulating the interior surfaces of the liner 14 is represented in crosssection in Figure 2.As shown the TBC system 20 includes a bond coat 24 overlying a substrate 22 which is typically but not necessarily the base material of the liner 14.Suitable materials for the substrate 22 and therefore the liner 14 include nickel iron and cobaltbase superalloys as well as nonmetallic structural materials including ceramic matrix composite CMC materials.The TBC system 20 further includes a thermal barrier coating hereinafter TBC 26 that provides the thermal protection for the substrate 22.A preferred material for the TBC 26 is an yttriastabilized zirconia YSZ a preferred composition being about 3 to about 8 weight percent yttria though other ceramic materials could be used such as alumina nonstabilized zirconia or zirconia partially or fully stabilized by magnesia ceria scandia or other oxides.The bond coat 24 may be an overlay coating such as MCrAlX where M is iron cobalt andor nickel and X is yttrium or another rare earth element or a diffusion aluminide coating such as a platinum aluminide. To address the above concerns the TBC 26 in Figure 2 is overcoated by a multilayer outer coating 28.As the outermost coating on the liner 14 the coating 28 defines the outermost surface 34 of the liner 14 and therefore also determines the surface roughness of the liner 14.The outer coating 28 of this invention is also tailored to serve as a barrier to thermal radiation while also having the advantage of being more resistant to erosion and CMAS infiltration than the TBC 26.The outer coating 28 achieves these features of the invention as a result of its composition and methods of deposition as described below. The coating of this invention defines the outermost surface of the component it protects and is formed of at least two layers having different compositions.An inner layer of the coating contains first and second alumina particles in a first silicacontaining matrix material that is free of zinc titanate and consists essentially of silica silicate andor mullite.The first alumina particles have a particle size that is coarser than the second alumina particles.An outer layer of the coating contains third alumina particles having a particle size distribution finer than the first and second alumina particles a glass material and zinc titanate in a second silicacontaining matrix material consisting essentially of silica silicate andor mullite.The outer layer of the coating has a surface roughness of not greater than 120 microinches Ra about 3 micrometers Ra and as the outermost surface of the component is subjected to the hot combustion gases within the combustor section. The method of this invention involves preparing first and second slurries from which the inner and outer layers of the coating are formed.As such the first slurry is free of zinc titanate and contains the first and second alumina particles in a first silicaforming binder material while the second slurry contains the third alumina particles glass material and zinc titanate in a second silicaforming binder material.Following deposition of the thermal barrier coating on the component the first slurry is deposited on the thermal barrier coating after which the second slurry is deposited on the inner layer.The slurry layers formed by the first and second slurries are fired to form the inner and outer layers respectively of the coating with the outer layer defining the outermost surface of the component. To achieve the desired surface roughness of not more than 120 microinches Ra about 3 micrometers Ra for the outermost surface 34 the outer layer 32 must have a smoother surface finish than the underlying TBC 26.As noted above the outer layer 32 of the coating 28 preferably contains in addition to alumina and silica a glass material and zinc titanate the latter of which promotes the reflectivity of the outer layer 32 by promoting the Mielike scattering effect of the coating 28.To achieve this capability the zinc titanate content is dispersed in the outer layer 32 of the coating 28.A particular composition for the outer layer 32 contains by weight about 5 to about 85 alumina about 0 to about 35 zinc titanate about 0 to about 35 of the glass material and the balance the silicacontaining matrix material.A more preferred composition for the outer layer 32 by weight is about 25 to about 65 alumina about 10 to about 25 zinc titanate about 10 to about 25 glass material and the balance the silica matrix material. After being sprayed on the inner layer 30 the slurry can be dried at room temperature and then fired to burn off the carrier liquid and yield a substantially homogeneous outer layer 32.The surface roughness of the outer layer 32 is in the range of about 20 to about 120 microinches Ra about 0.5 to 3 micrometers Ra preferably not more than 40 microinches Ra about 1 micrometer Ra which is significantly smoother than that possible for the TBC 26 when deposited by APS.A suitable thickness for outer layer 32 is about 0.0005 to about 0.005 inch about 10 to about 130 micrometers. As with the inner layer 30 the outer layer 32 is deposited in the form of a slurry that is subsequently dried and fired.Contrary to the slurry for the inner layer 30 the slurry for the outer layer 32 preferably contains alumina particlesin a single particle size range and which are finer than the alumina particles used to form the inner layer 30.The alumina particles constitute about 5 to about 80 weight percent of the slurry more preferably about 25 to about 65 weight percent of the slurry for the outer layer 32.A suitable alumina powder for the outer layer 32 is commercially available under the designation A16SG from ALCOA and has an average particle size of about 0.48 micrometers. The slurry is prepared by combining the alumina powders with a silica precursor and a sufficient amount of carrier liquid to enable the slurry to be applied by spraying.A suitable precursor for the slurry is a silicone such as polymethyl siloxane a particular example of which is a resin manufactured by GE Silicones under the name SR350 and classified as a methylsesquisiloxane mixture of the polysiloxane family.A suitable carrierliquid is an anhydrous alcohol such as methanol or ethanol though acetone isopropyl alcohol or trichloroethylene could be used.A suitable slurry contains about 40 to about 65 weight percent of the alumina powder preferably having the two particle size ranges discussed above about 1 to about 45 weight percent of the silica precursor and about 5 to about 90 weight percent of the carrier liquid.The coarser and finer alumina particles preferably constitute by weight about 20 to about 55 and about 20 to about 40 respectively of the slurry.After being sprayed on the TBC 26 using any suitable sprayer known in the art the composition can be dried at room temperature and then fired to burn off the carrier liquid and yield a substantially homogeneous inner layer 30.A suitable thickness for inner layer 30 is in a range of about 0.0003 to about 0.007 inch about 7.5 to about 180 micrometers. As a result of their different compositions the inner and outer layers 30 and 32 define distinct inner and outer zones of the coating 28 respectively as represented in Figure 2.The thickness structure and properties of the outer coating 28 can be tailored by the firing temperatures and durations used for each layer 30 and 32.A suitable firing technique is to heat the sprayed composition at a rate of about 10F per minute about 5.5Cminute to a maximum hold temperature of about 800F to about 2500F about 425C to about 1370C.The hold temperature is held for a duration of at least one hour to convert the precursor to the desired silicacontaining matrix material and at least partially sinter the resulting ceramic constituents of the layers 30 and 32.The degree to which the layers 30 and 32 are sintered can be tailored for the service temperature of the component.In a preferred embodiment the layers 30 and 32 are not sintered to full density so that voids not shown are present in the coating 28.The voids serve to reduce the thermal conductivity of the coating 28 as well as provide stress relief."
