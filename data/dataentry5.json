    "EP1526069":"The above description was primarily for a case in which the electric switch was usedto change gears but it can be used as a switch for actuating a shifting mechanism when the shift step decision is made automatically.Here again the electric switch is provided to the handlebar as well and not just to the brake lever so the shifting can be carried out smoothly and quickly.When a plurality of two types of electric switches are provided at least one of the first and second types of electric switches can be provided to the handlebar including the bracket or to the chassis frame that supports the riders body the chassis frame that supports the crank spindle.Thus the scope of the invention should not be limited by the specific structures disclosed.Instead the true scope of the invention should be determined by the following claims. As shown by the arrow B in Figure 5 the movement direction of the movable component of the second electric switch 14DF lies in a vertical plane that includes the forward direction line and intersects the horizontal direction at an angle.Similarly as shown by the arrow C in Figure 5 the movement direction of the movable component of the third switch 14DR lies in a vertical plane that includes the forward direction line and intersects the horizontal direction at an angle. The second electric switch 14DF and the third electric switch 14DR are positioned so that they can be easily pressed with the thumb of the hand firmly gripping the handlebar or the handlebar integral component.In this embodiment the gear is lowered with the second and third electric switches just before the rider forcefully tries to transmit pedaling force to the crank in order to make a transition from a high speed state to another high speed state via a low speed state.Since two electric switches 14DF and 14DR are provided the rider can execute a quick downshift by selecting the switch that is closer to the portion of the handlebar gripped up to that point. In a more specific embodiment the first electrical shift control switch and the second electrical shift control switch are coupled for integral movement between a first position a second position and an intermediate position between the first position and the second position.A biasing mechanism can be provided for biasing the first electrical shift control switch and the second electrical shift control switch to the intermediate position.A third electrical shift control switch also can be disposed in proximity to the brake lever wherein the third electrical shift control switch is spaced apart from the second electrical shift control switch and can be used to operate the shifting mechanism to move in the downshifting direction.The second electrical shift control switch may be mounted on a brake lever bracket adjacent to the brake lever and the third electrical shift control switch may be mounted on the brake lever bracket adjacent to the handlebar.In this case upshifting events may be performed when the ridexs hand is operating the brake lever and downshifting events may be performed when the riders hand is located on the handlebar or the brake lever bracket. Second and third electric switches 14DF and 14DR are provided to two different locations.The second electric switch 14DF is mounted on the front of the attachment component brake lever bracket 16 adjacent to and directly above the brake lever 15 and the third electric switch 14DR is mounted on the rear of the attachment component 16 adjacent to the handlebar 6. While the above is a description of various embodiments of the present invention further modifications may be employed without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.For example the size shape location or orientation of the various components may be changed as desired.The functions of one element may be performed by two and vice versa.",
